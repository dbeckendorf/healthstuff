<h1>Gout</h1>
<p><img src="thegout.jpg" class="intro"></p>
<p><img src="gout.jpg" class="left">Gout is a form of inflammatory arthritis characterized by recurrent attacks of red, tender, and swollen joints. It  is caused by elevated levels of uric acid in the blood stream. Uric acid is a normal component of urine, and is the result of the metabolic breakdown of a family of chemicals called purines. We intake a lot of purines when we eat, because half of our DNA is made of two members of the purine family (Adenosine and Guanosine are both purines). Therefore, anytime we eat anything that has DNA, we are intaking purines. As a side note, theobromine (found in chocolate) and caffeine are also both purines, but don't stop eating chocolate or drinking coffee just because you have gout; the concentrations of these purines is extremely minor compared to our main source of purines: eating the DNA of other organisms.</p>
<p><img src="uricacid.png" class="right">Gout occurs because at really high blood concentrations, uric acid crystallizes. Several factors contribute to high blood concentrations. The main one is that your kidneys aren't excreting the uric acid fast enough. This could be due to genetic factors or kidney damage. Other factors come into play as well, though. One of them is temperature. The lower the temperature, the higher the risk of crystallization by the higher levels of uric acid. This is why the extremes of the body (toes and fingers) are usually affected. The outer extremeties of the body are cooler than the rest of the body. It also explains why gout attacks come most often in the wee hours of the night, while the victim is asleep. Our body temperatures are lower when we're asleep than they are when we are active. Another factor influencing crystalization is dehydration. The less water your body has, the less uric acid it can dissolve. Undissolved uric acid crystallizes because it has nowhere else to go. Yet ANOTHER factor is a rapid change in uric acid because it floods the system, not giving the kidnys enough time to flush the uric acid. This is why gout sufferers shouldn't eat a 32-oz. steak in one sitting. 32 ounces of steak is a lot of purine, and eating it all at once will flood the blood with uric acid.</p>
<p><img src="cherries.jpg" class="left">Now that we know what gout is and what causes it, we can discuss ways to prevent it. Of course, there are medications such as allopurinol and colchicine. A helathy lifestyle such as physical fitness and a healthy weight help, too. Natural preventatives include <a href="cherry.html">cherries</a>, coffee, vitamin C, and diary products (especially fat-free dairy products). If you drink alcohol, wine presents less of a risk than beer or spirits. Sleep apnea makes gout worse by the release of purines from oxygen-starved cells, so if you have both sleep apnea and gout, treating the sleep apnea may help the gout, too.</p>
