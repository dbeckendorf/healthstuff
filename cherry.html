    <h3>The Health Benefits of</h3>
    <h1>Cherries</h1>
    <p><img src="cherries.jpg" class="intro"></p>
    <p>Cherries have many health benefits. Below are three of them. You may notice that the people in study ate quite a bit of cherries for the study. However, they also achieved tremendous results. Most of us don't need our results to be that extreme. For example, we don't need enough energy to complete a marathon 13% faster. Most of us would be happy just making it through an average day easier. Therefore, most of us don't need nearly as many cherries as the athletes in the study ate. The researchers merely used the experiments to prove exactly how effective cherries are at what they do. The conclusion? Cherries are VERY effective at what they do.</p>
    <h2>Gout</h2>
    <p><img src="gout.jpg" class="left">Cherries have a chemical called Anthocyanin. Anthocyanin has been shown to reduce uric acid, which causes gout. In one study, 633 people ate fresh cherries, and had 35% fewer gout attacks than those who didn't consume cherries. When the researchers added allopurinol (prescription gout medication), attacks were reduced by a whopping 75% compared to those who took neither allopurinol or cherries.</p>
    <h2>Exercise Performance</h2>
    <p><img src="sprint.jpg" class="right">Research has shown that the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant compounds in cherries may help relieve exercise-induced muscle pain, damage, and inflammation. Tart cherries seem to be more effective than sweet cherries, though. A study in 27 endurance runners demonstrated that eating 480 mg of powdered tart cherries for 10 days averaged 13% faster race times. Another study found that drinking 4 ounces of tart cherry juice daily help people recover quicker and reduces muscle soreness after repeated sprint exercises.</p>
    <h2>Insomnia</h2>
    <p><img src="insomnia.jpg" class="left">Cherries also have  chemical called melatonin, which can induce sleep. In a 2-week study in older adults with insomnia, it was shown that drinking 1 cup of cherry juice before bed increased sleep time by 84 minutes.</p>
