<h3>The Health Benefits of</h3>
<h1>Grapes</h1>
<p><img src="grape.jpg" class="intro"></p>
<p><img src="godgrapes.jpg" class="left">Grapes appear to be a food sent from God. They appear to be good for every illness from cancer to the common cold. The secret to their great abilities is a chemical called resveratrol. Resveratrol is a chemical found in grapes that the plant releases when it has been injured or when it is under attack by pathogens, such as bacteria or viruses. It appears to do a lot more than just fight pathogens, though.</p>
<h2>Cancer</h2>
<p><img src="pinkribbon.jpg" class="right">Resveratrol, combined with several other compounds found in grapes, has been shown to have anti-cancer characteristics. Grape extracts have been shown to block the growth and spread of human colon cancer cells in test-tube studies, and in human trials actual fresh grapes were shown to decrease the markers of colon cancer risk. Laboratory and mouse models have also shown it to be effective against breast cancer.</p>
<h2>Diabetes</h2>
<p>There is much evidence that grapes reduce blood sugar level, and some indications that resveratrol may be the chemical responsible for it. Resveratrol has been shown to increase insulin sensitivity, which may lower blood sugar levels, and it increases the number of glucose receptors (the cellular machines that bring sugar into the cell) on cell membranes, which also may lower blood sugar level.</p>
<h2>Eye Damage</h2>
<p><img src="eye.jpg" class="left">In a test-tube study, resveratrol was found to protect the retina from damage from ultraviolet light. Two other chemicals found in grapes, lutein and zeaxanthin, have been found to do the same thing. According to another study, resveratrol may also help protet against glaucoma and cataracts.</p>
<h2>Depression</h2>
<p>A study in healthy, young adults showed that grape juice improved their mood 20 minutes after consumption. Resveratrol specifically has been shown to improve the mood of rats (although I must ask myself how the researchers knew the rats were in a good mood or not).</p>
<h2>Viruses and Infections</h2>
<p><img src="virus.jpg" class="right">Numerous compounds in grapes have been shown to protect against and fight bacterial and viral infections. For one, grapes are a moderately good source of vitamin C. Additionally, grape skin extract has been shown to protect against the flu in test-tube studies, including the herpes virus and chicken pox (it also stopped yeast infections). When added to different foods, resveratrol was shown to prevent the growth of </i>E. coli</i>.</p>
