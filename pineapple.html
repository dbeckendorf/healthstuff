<h3>The Health Benefits of</h3>
<h1>Pineapple</h1>
<p><img src="pineapple.jpg" class="intro"></p>
<p><img src="meattenderizer.jpg" class="left">Pineapple's main claim to fame is a chemical called Bromelain. Bromelain is a known anti-inflammatory and meat tenderizer (check the ingredients of the meat tenderizer you buy at your local store; many list Bromelain, which is extracted from pineapple). It is also really high in vitamin C and manganese. The health effects of vitamin C are well-known, and manganese is a trace element necessary for healthy bones.</p>
<h2>Coughing and Asthma</h2>
<p><img src="cough.jpg" class="right">The benefits of pineapple juice as a cough suppressant are dependent upon the cause of the cough. Bromelain is an anti-inflammatory, and therefore reduces coughing if the cause is inflammation of the respiratory tract (such as the case of asthma). Pineapple juice also has lytic properties, which means is helps to thin out mucus. This is helpful if the cause of the coughing is mucus, such as in allergies.</p>
<p>For a traditional Indian cough remedy, mix the following:</p>
<p id="ol">1 cup of pineapple juice</p>
<p id="ol">pinch of salt</p>
<p id="ol">pinch of pepper</p>
<p id="ol">1 1/2 tbsp of honey</p>
<p>To add a kick to this recipe, try adding three inches of ginger root, 1/4 of a cup of lemon juice, 1/2 of a tsp of cayenne pepper, or any combination of these three. I'm pretty sure somebody, somewhere out there would recommend a shot of whiskey be thrown into the mix as well.</p>
<h2>Other Uses of Bromelain</h2>
<p><img src="gout.jpg" class="left">Since Bromelain is anti-inflammatory, it also helps with arthritis and <a href="gout.html">gout</a>. The fact that it is a meat tenderizer means that it is a great digestive aid (that's what meat tenderizers do: they "pre-digest" the meat, making it more tender).</p>
