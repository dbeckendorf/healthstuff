<p>My name is Analou from Linamon, Philipines, in the Lanao Del Norte Province. I have worked in Hong Kong since 2012. My brother and mother joined Aimglobal in 2013, and finally convinced me to join in 2016. I had no interest in this business because of all the negative things I had heard about networking and pyramids. I finally changed my mind after watching the videos on YouTube about Aimglobal and their success stories. I was then excited to join and went home to the Phillipines to join. I found a way to join because I know I can change not only my own life but also my family's life and the lives of many people. My main reason, however, is my parents.</p>
<p>As I continued working I learned online marketing and my group, Aces International, formed. I do this part-time in my spare time, learning from leaders in Hong Kong, the Philipines, Singapore, and Dubai. I am now the top distributor in Hong Kong.</p>
