<h3>The Health Benefits of</h3>
<h1>Plums</h1>
<p><img src="plums.jpg" class="intro"</p>
<p><img src="cherries.jpg" class="left">Plums are incredibly healthy for us. This should come as no surprise, because <a href="cherries.html"></a>cherries</a> are incredibly healthy, too, and cherries are technically a species of plum. The species of plum we buy most in the store is <i>Prunus domestica</i>, while cherries are ususally <i>Prunus avium</i>. Not surprisingly, they have quite a few benefits in common, but one is merely MORE effective than the other.</p>
<p>It is also noteworthy that prunes are merely dehydrated plums, just like raisins are dehydrated grapes. Any health benefit that comes from plums will also come from prunes.</p>
<h2>Constipation</h2>
<p><img src="cosntipation.jpg" class="right">Plums have been shown to be more effective at reducing constipation that psyllium, which is the main active ingredient in Metamucil. This is due partly to the fiber content of plums, and partly due to a chemical called <b>sorbitol</b>, which is a sugar alcohol with laxative effects. That being said, too many plums cause diarrhea. For this reason it is important to limit prune intake to 1/4 to 1/2 a cup per day. If you are drinking prune juice instead of eating prunes, limit the intake to 4 to 8 ounces per day.</p>
<h2>Diabetes</h2>
<p><img src="diabetes.jpg" class="left">A study in the journal <i>Biomedical Research</i> has shown that plums aid in reducing blood sugar and trigyceride leels.They do this in two ways. The first is that they are really high in fiber. Fiber slows the rate at which the body absorbs carbs (sugar), making the blood sugar level rise slowly instead of spike. The second is that they increased levels of adinopectin, a hormone that plays a role in blood sugar levels. Another study published in <i>The British Medical Journal</i>states that the flavonoids present in plums exert protective effects against insulin resistance and help lower the risk of type-2 diabetes.</p>
<h2>Osteoporosis</h2>
<p><img src="osteoporosis.jpg" class="right">Of all the fruits, plums <b>appear</b> to be the most effective at both preventing and reversing bone loss.  Polyphenols, along with the potassium content present in  plums, encourage the bonesâ€™ formation, improve bone density, and prevent bone loss. A research study published in the <i>Journal of Nutrition</i> demonstrated that regular consumption of dried plums helps restore bone density that is lost due to aging.</p>
